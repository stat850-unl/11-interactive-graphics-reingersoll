# Animated and Interactive Graphics

## Instructions

Use the [TidyTuesday Cocktail Data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-26/readme.md) to create a shiny applet containing the following:

- A visual exploration of the cocktail data
- A way for a user to search through cocktail recipes by ingredient

Your applet should make use of reactivity in both components, but the specifics of what you do and how you do it are up to you.

Once you're satisfied with your applet, upload it to [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and edit this README to contain a link to your applet.

* I uploaded my code to shiny last night, when there were still some issues with it to test and see how it worked. However, after correcting those issues and re-uploading it, the app is no longer loading for me. I tried re-uploading it by deleting the app on the shiny website and the folder it created in my file and repeating the same steps as before to re-deploy it, and is still not loading for me.
